# 100 Days of Machine Learning - frextrite's Log

A little bit of background: I have been involved in Machine Learning since the past year or so. I've taken university courses and online courses(Andrew NG's, Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning and currently taking up Andrew NG's course on CNN) in this brief period of time. However, I've been into ML on and off(well, mostly off), and just have basic knowledge of scikit-learn and tensorflow. With this 100 Days of ML Code challenge I would like to strengthen my code writing skills that is get an insight into sci-kit learn library, tensorflow and also keras.

## Day 0: July 6, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Initialised the repository to keep track of my 100 Days of ML journey

**Thoughts** : Hope I can continue through the 100 days and do not stop in between :)

## Day 1: July 7, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Created a simple Linear Regression model using scikit-learn library, baby-steps! Also, scraped Kaggle for ML datasets.

**Thoughts** : Maybe implement my own version of Linear Regression model in the future

## Day 2: July 8, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Created a single layered Neural Network MNIST classifier using tensorflow. That's a combined dive into the world of tensorflow and neural networks!

**Thoughts** : The official tensorflow tutorial, MNIST for ML Beginners is really good as everything is explained in deep. I'm thinking of implementing a Deep Neural Network MNIST classifier and a CNN MNIST classifier and compare their accuracy.

## Day 3: July 9, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Created a Deep Neural Network MNIST Classifier. Learned a few things about tensorflow and Neural Networks in general while constructing this model, details inside the work folder.

**Thoughts** : Increasing the depth of a Neural Network and increasing the number of epochs increases the accuracy of the model but this tends to saturate at a particular limit. Further increase in both doesn't result in greater accuracies.

## Day 4: July 10, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Studied about various optimization techniques, including Gradient Descent and Adam Optimizer.

**Thoughts** : Implement my own various of these optimizing techniques maybe.

## Day 5: July 11, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Attempted first assignment of Week 1 of Coursera's Convolutional Neural Networks course where I implemented forward propagation from scratch using numpy.

**Thoughts** : CNNs are fun! numpy is a powerful library!

**Course Link** : [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/)

## Day 6: July 12, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Fixed my Deep MNIST Classifier and implemented SGD correctly. Getting higher accuracy with the new model. Also watched an introduction video for tensorflow js.

**Thoughts** : I think I've hit the accuracy ceiling with Deep Neaural Networks, time for CNN model.

## Day 7: July 13, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Created Convolution Neural Network model for MNIST classifier. Learned a lot about CNNs in this process.

**Thoughts** : I will retrain the model with more epochs and hope for higher accuracy. Dropouts really help a lot.

**Update** : Reran the model with updated dropout probabilities and got an increase in accuracy.

## Day 8: July 14, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Thought of creating a CNN classifier for classifying cats and dogs. PC ran out of memory loading the images.

**Thoughts** : Find an optimized way of loading images or get more RAM.

## Day 9: July 15, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Watched videos on how to load images into python and convert them into arrays. Also dived into tf.keras

**Thoughts** : Use tf.keras for quicker model initialization.

## Day 10: July 16, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Going a bit theoretical for a few days.

## Day 11: August 4, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Read few articles and watched videos on RNN. Grasped the basic idea behind RNNs but still need to figure out its inner workings.

**Thoughts** : Time to read papers/more articles related to RNN and its implementation.

## Day 12: August 5, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Reading MSCOCO Dataset Paper. Read few more articles on RNN and NLP. Preping for a huge project coming up ahead.
